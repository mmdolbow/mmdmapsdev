This is a site to host files for an instructional workshop on Google Maps Mashups. If you have taken my workshop or are interested in developing a workshop on your own, please feel free to download the materials. If you re-use any of my materials, please just give me credit.  Many thanks to Nianwei Liu for his arcgislink.js library used in Exercise 3. See http://code.google.com/p/gmaps-utility-gis/ for his latest. Previously hosted in http://code.google.com/p/mmdmapsdev
